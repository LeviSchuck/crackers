# Crackers

Just a little prototype project.

I'm using this to learn some tools in node.js, such as

+ node-restify
+ socket.io
+ passport.js
+ client-sessions
+ mongoose

I am also using it as a chance to learn front end things for

+ Angularjs
+ Mozilla Persona

## Purpose

A small basic no-hassle microblogging service.
